**Prompt for Manus (Gamification Expert):**

> **Role:** You are a senior **Gamification & Learning-Experience Consultant**.
> **Audience:** An in-house product team building **Pika** – a speaking-robot that teaches English to Vietnamese children (5-10 yrs).
> **Inputs supplied:**
>
> 1. **“Gamification BRD”** – current business-requirements draft for the upcoming reward / progression system.
> 2. **“Comprehensive Design Framework for Pika Robot”** – holistic blueprint covering developmental principles, engagement architecture, hardware limits, feature-prioritisation, validation processes and future road-map (attached).
>
> **Mission:**
> Design a lean, outside-expert-powered execution plan that *sharpens* the BRD and drives a shippable V1 of the gamification layer **within 8–10 weeks**.
>
> **What we need from you:**
>
> 1. **Expert-Contribution Map** – skill profiles we should source externally (e.g. reward-economy designer, UX motion artist, child-psychology researcher, Unity/Canvas prototyper) and *what exact artefacts* each role must deliver.
> 2. **End-to-End Workflow** – phased diagram showing:
>
>    * **Gap audit** of the BRD vs. Design Framework
>    * **Co-creation sprints** (concept → paper prototype → playable prototype)
>    * **Play-test loops** with target users, using the built-in Feature Prioritisation & Validation funnels
>    * **Implementation support** (code hand-off & KPI handshake).
> 3. **RACI matrix** blending *in-house* and *external* actors.
> 4. **I/O Contract Table** – for every phase: required inputs, expected outputs, acceptance criteria, tools (e.g. FigJam, JSON spec, MQTT demo build).
> 5. **Lean-Execution Guardrails** – keep scope aligned with:
>
>    * Hardware & bandwidth ceilings (480×320 TFT, 0.8 Mbps)
>    * Multi-sensor / multi-modal interaction set (buttons, touch-sensors, ASR)
> 6. **Reward-System Design Kit** – reference proven mechanics (progress paths, meaningful badges, surprise rewards) tuned for 5-10 yrs motivation drivers.
> 7. **External-Resource Channels** – recommend where to find / brief experts (specialist Slack communities, Upwork talent filters, academic partnerships).
> 8. **Timeline & Milestones** – Gantt-style outline with demoable checkpoints every two weeks; include risk & mitigation notes.
> 9. **Success Metrics** – quantitative (daily active learning minutes, streak retention) and qualitative (delight score in post-test interviews).
>
> **Formatting expectations:**
> • Return your answer as a concise **consulting deck outline** (max 4 pages) + an **Excel/CSV task board template**.
> • Use numbered sections, swimlane diagrams or ASCII tables where helpful.
> • Highlight any assumptions.
>
> **Constraints & Reminders:**
> • All suggestions must respect Pika’s Feature-Prioritisation rubric (impact × feasibility) and be executable by a small core team (<5 developers).
> • Encourage reusable content pipelines / content-creation platform approaches for continuous expert input.
> • Prioritise *playable* prototypes over heavy docs; aim for one-sprint validation.
> • Keep pedagogy aligned with developmental and cultural principles stated in the framework.

“Please deliver the above in Markdown. Start with a one-paragraph executive summary, then the sections in order.”
